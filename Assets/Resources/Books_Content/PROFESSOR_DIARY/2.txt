10th of June, 1912

The workers have been digging our way through what seems to be abandoned mines... These idiots have no idea what is in store for them down below.
I have been being a fool, thinking my ancestor's palace could be found so easily...

.. Must keep up with the good work...

... Need to get rid of them as soon as I can figure out where we are headed... Nobody must known of this excavation goal...

Still, I cannot help but wonder whether the Old ways have been upheld, during all this time? Except me, does anyone know of this temple? What awaits me further down?

...

Will they turn out hostile, even to me?
