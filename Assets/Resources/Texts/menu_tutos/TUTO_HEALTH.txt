- Physical health :

Your physical health is visible within your inventory ("i"). It drops when you fall from very high, or get hurt by an hostile.

- Mental health :

Whenever you are looking at something disturbing (corpsing, ghost, monster, etc.), you will start feeling awkward.Vision will get blurry, hearbeat speed will increase and you may experience strange things.
The only to retrieve your original sanity is to look away until it comes back to its normal state.
