(This is the dirary of Jack H.P Taylor, private detective)

13th of June, 1912

The villagers of this - up to now - fine village of Owl's Howlers, New England, called me, begging me for my help.
It would seem an old crazy guy have been undergoing ooze experiments in his mansion, up the hill.

Everything started when he hired three workers from Owl's Holwers, a few months ago - on the conditions they would remain silent as for what their jobs consisted in.
As they were well-paid to do the latters, things would be so far so good. Soon afterwards, the three workers came one afternoon, warning us they had to stay over the mansion
for the next few days, as they reportedly were on the eve of a mesmerizing discovery. What did they mean?

Several days passed, no one heard of the workers, nor anything that might have occured in the meantime...

Which gets us to the most intriguing part:

The owner of the mansion, John Marsh, age unknown (thought to be more than 80?), used to hire the services of the village's gardener, even offered him a logding in his garden.
Little time after the villagers became aware of the workers' vanishment, the gardener hurried back, pale as cotton, mumbling inconsistent sentences.
He would speak of dire screams coming from inside the mansion, unearthly lights also coming from the latter, and... claimed to have been hearing voices...

The gardener seems to show extreme paranoia, agoraphobia and even the slightest contacts with anybody would terrify him, whom used to be friendly with even outsiders...

None dared to venture since that fateful day near the manor, and obviously the workers were never heard of again.

This could be an interesting case, I'm in!

I got my way to that place, ready for my survey. What a downpour, this is my lucky day... Damn it!
However, I should proceed with extreme cautions, this place makes me feel so uneasy...
