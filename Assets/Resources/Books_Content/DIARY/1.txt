(This is the diary of Jack H.P Taylor, private detective)

13th of June, 1912

The villagers of a small village in New England, called for my service.
It would seem they have recently been worried about a crazy old guy, dwelling up the hill.

Everything started when he hired three workers from the village, a few weeks back. Nobody knows why.
As days passed by, no one ever heard of any of them again, yet nobody is willing to go near the house up the hill...

As far I as know, the owner of the house, John Marsh, does not interact at all with the locals. He used to hire a gardener, whom nobody knows anything about.
Little time after the villagers became aware of the workers' vanishing, the gardener hurried down to the hamlet, apparently panick-striken and mumbling inconsistent sentences.
He would speak of dire screams coming from inside the mansion, unearthly sightings, and died of a heart attack a few hours afterwards.

Superstition or supernatural events, curiosity is killing me. I am in!
