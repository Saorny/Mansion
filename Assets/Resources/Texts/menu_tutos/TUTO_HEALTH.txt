- Physical health :

Your physical health is visible within your inventory ("i"). It drops when you fall from very high, or get hurt by an hostile. When your health drops to zero, you will die.

- Mental health :

Whenever you are looking at something disturbing (corpse, ghost, monster, etc.), you will start feeling awkward. Vision will get gradually blurrier and blurrier, hearbeat speed will increase and you may experience strange things.
The only way to retrieve your original sanity is to look away until it comes back to its normal state.
